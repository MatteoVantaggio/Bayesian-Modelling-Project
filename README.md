# Bayesian Modelling Project

This project was developed for the **Bayesian Modelling** course of the MSc in *Statistical Methods and Applications* at Sapienza University of Rome.

## Objective

The aim of this work is to perform Bayesian inference using **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)**. We estimate the full posterior distribution of the model parameters and evaluate model fit and uncertainty through graphical and statistical diagnostics.

## Methods

- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling
- Posterior summaries and credible intervals
- Posterior predictive checks

## Main packages used

- `mvgam`, `mgcv` 
- `ggplot2`, `bayesplot`
- `R Markdown` for reporting

## Files

- `bayesian_project.Rmd`: full R Markdown source with code and explanations
- `bayesian_project.html`: rendered version of the report
